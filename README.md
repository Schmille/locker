# locker
A simplistic logging library for go.

Locker is meant to be very simple with little to no configuration. 
I was inspired by [logbuch](https://github.com/emvi/logbuch) and decided I wanted to create my own little logging library.

I do not recommend using this for large scale or professional applications, as it may not be fast or configurable enough to 
suite your needs.
